#title
As a local church, IES loves to see other local churches growing.
#description
IES is intentional about being an asset to the churches of Indonesia. We have connections, experience, resources and contacts that can build up our neighboring Indonesian churches. We all desire to see God's Kingdom grow so we partner with our neighbors to see us all grow together.
::

IES is not an island, it is part of the GSJA, the Indonesian Assemblies of God. IES intends to be an asset to the Churches of Indonesia. IES invests in the local church by sharing connections, experience, education oportunities, technical & ministry training because we desire to see God's Kingdom grow. We want to see the GSJA thrive in every corner of Indonesia.

We may not all speak the same language but we do serve the same God and King who calls us to grow His Kingdom, not our own little silo'd version of a kingdom. We are always looking to partner with others who have long term local presence, who can direct new believers to churches that will connect with them in ministry and will see the ministry investment through, over the long term. This is played out in mission outreach but also in our coordination with and encouragement of our neighboring churches, their pastors and leadership.

We count it a great privilege that during covid we were able to support so many pastors with additional food to suplement their own budgets that were running so thin. We have had the privilage this year of offering Social Media training for minstry teams in our area with both English speaking IC's and Indonesian speaking GSJA churches participating and developing skills. Our staff have had opportunity to present in conferences, participate in district leadership in numerous areas. We value the opportunity to invest in other churches and we desire to be percieved as an asset, not a competitor.
