IES is a Church made up of all kinds of people

#description
IES like other ICs is a church made up of hundreds of different kinds of people from different places, backgrounds, traditions and experiences.

Indonesia is a nation of many people groups. The people of Indonesia speak more than 730 unique languages, representing even more ethnic and cultural groups. In Indonesia, an international church, or IC, is typically a church of Indonesians and a church of people from all over the world. In IES English is a second, third, or even fourth language for many of our people, but it is their language of worship. <!--more-->For some it's the primary language through which they connect to God in prayer and worship and for others, it's a language that works for them while away from their home language setting.

IC members may have had a global education experience, work or attend school in English, or were raised in a primarily English language home in Indonesia or overseas. Some have come to faith through relationships with believers where the common language was English. The one thing that is common is the English language the other is a desire to know God and grow in Him.
