# A Church Of All Ages

IES, like most International churches, is not limited to a certain age demographic. One of our core values is, "Kids are not the church of tomorrow. They are the church today!". This goes for any other age group or demographic category. We take this seriously, investing resources in all age groups and targeting their growth, not just their activity.

Many ICs start by connecting with younger people, often because they are open to change and connecting with Christ in a new way. As they get married and raise their kids in the church, these parents desire for their kids to grow up with faith as a constant. In many cases this projects a very different family experience from how they grew up. There's a tremendous opportunity for growth and teaching with families who are changing their generational trajectory by following Christ.

Their desire for their kids to know God leads to a passion for their siblings, parents, aunts and uncles to know Him too. Many of our members have parents who have yet come to faith in Christ. Some even have strong cultural opposition to the idea with very traditional religious experience. God, however, is a long term investor and over time, ICs become a bridge. As those beloved elders see the impact of God on the lives of their children and grandchildren they are draw to accept the transformation Christ brings in their own lives.

It is great to see God bringing whole families to faith. God is a long-term investor indeed and over the years we have seen many whole families come to faith in Christ. This is why the church as a whole needs to invest in missions for the long haul, because God can do miracles in an instant but most of His great work is done over the course of many years.
