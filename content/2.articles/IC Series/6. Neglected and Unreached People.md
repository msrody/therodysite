When we think of the unreached we often think of distant people in small villages, but IC's in cities have a tremendous capacity to reach and develop believers who are from neglected or uncreached people groups. backgrounds, traditions and expereinces.

# Neglected And Unreached People

Neglected Peoples are socio-linguistic or ethnic groups where the Gospel has had little penetration and where not enough has been done to reach them. In that sense they are neglected. For this reason, few of these people have come to faith in Christ. Some are out right obstinate toward the gospel.

An IC is a great place to connect with neglected or unreached people. Our ICâ€™s in Indonesia are strategically positioned to impact these people groups. Foreigner are rarely accepted in these neglected or unreached communities. Even Indonesias, who are not of the community struggle to connect. So our traditional missionaries, foreign or Indonesian, have a hard time reaching them. Yet, these communities send their students to school in cities where IC's thrive and where people from insular communities have the opportunity to see and experience new things.

Here, we have the potential for significant impact. Some of those who come to faith will go back to their communities and take their new faith with them. Going back may not be possible for others once they have come to faith in Christ. Many will remain in the city and grow in their church, but they will remain a resource for their community at home and a contact for Christ. Their family and community continue to observe their lives and, over time come to value what God is doing.

This impact of IC's is a powerful, long-term investment in reaching the lost, opening doors in these neglected communities. As I often say, God is a long-term investor, not a day trader. As impatient as we may be, patience is required to maximize impact in hard-to-reach communities, but the opportunity for change is increased when we also account for those God will also bring to us.
