# Ministry and Minister Development

IC's are a great place for ministry development. Our people tend to be creative, motivated, connected and open to change. They're not locked to historic traditions of style and are often able to transit between the old and the new because they do value their own traditions. They want to grow in faith and knowledge of God's word and see it lived out in their day and they have the time to do that. IC's are a great place to try new approaches.

In IES this is lived out in one of our IES Core Values: "Everyone's a Minister". It's not just a slogan for the wall. It's not actually on our walls, but it is impressed regularly and consistently on our congregation. With the transient nature of our congregation, we are always looking for and developing new leaders.  This allows our people to expand their ministry experience and to step up into new roles, trying new ministries.  Change and growth are encouraged and consistently promoted for growth.

At IES, we have found that this nature of our church can be very beneficial for others as well. We have a well-structured internship program that takes people from IES or other churches or other countries and gives them experience to develop in life and ministry. We have seen many of our staff launch out and plant churches. We have hosted many missionaries to expose them to the possibilities of International Church ministry while they prepare for their ministry here in Indonesia.
