Thoughts on communicating the power and impact of International Church ministry.
::

Knowing we will soon set out to communicate the power and impact of International Church ministry to our current and future partners in American churches, it seemed important to process and articulate the variety of things that make international church ministry, and ministry in IES in particular, unique and impactful.<!--more--> This is particularly important for communicating where some may have never lived outside of their cultural context or even their immediate community. Around the time I finished my frist draft of ideas for this series of short articles I was made aware of an article in the MICN website, by Andrew Lupton, entitled [Who Attends International Churches](https://micn.org/3-who-attends-international-churches-micn-missiology-series-by-andrew-lupton/).

MICN is Mission International Church Network, an association of International churches that have developed out of a passion to see these IC's, as we call them, flourish wherever they may be planted. I share this here, right off the top, so that you know we're not the only ones thinking about this. In fact Internationl Churches have a long history and are having expanding impact in most major global cities and many second and third cities as well. IC's are a growing global phenomena and a powerful context for ministry impact.

My IC experience started when our family moved to Tehran in 1978. We started attending the Tehran International Assembly as soon as we arrived and were quickly absorbed into the community. Though we were there only 10 months, before the upheaval of revolution, the church community and impact of it's ministry have continued through out my life.

Subsequently my wife and I have been part of international churches in Indonesia and the Philippines, both as attenders and ministers. We pastored a church in the US for 13 years. The church, Whatcom New Life Assembly in Ferndale, Washington became a very multi-cultural, if not international church, even though it is located in a relatively homogenious community. I feel this array of experience gives me a perspective on what makes the IC ministry quite important, unique and even a model for healthy churches.

An IC is not your average church. Some are small, our church in Baguio City Philippines, at Camp John Hay, rarely had attendance over 60 in the time I attended. Some are large, with several having multiple thousands in more than one campus. In those IC's that thrive with health and long term impact, be they large or small, there are some common threads.

Typically a thriving IC is marked by diversity in many forms. This is evident in the range of ethnicity represented in the congregation. Most thriving IC's will grow to be very multi-national in nature, even if they start out with just one culture group. When you bring people from many countries together there is a diversity that requires intentionality for unity and growth. Different cultures in the church bring difference of expectations, religious experience and expression.

How all this diversity comes together is what makes IC's unique. This uniqueness has a great power to impact all involved. In an international church, we see and begin to value different approaches as we value the community we worship with. Things we may have looked ascance at or never considered in a more homogenious setting are now viewed up close. Properly handled, an IC becomes a place where all participants will assess where their culture ends and faith begins.

This openness to accept differences begets an openness to growth. I have always seen spiritual growth happen at a much faster pace in IC's than in churches with homogenous congregations. People come for the fellowship but are touched by God because they are open to the changes He is initiating in their lives. We've seen more than one individual who claimed to be Christian come to faith in Christ in the our IC's.
