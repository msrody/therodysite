##### Newsletter - 2024 04 24

### Mike & Chelly Rody :br AGWM Missionary Associates :br Pastoring and Teaching in Jakarta, Indonesia.

To our friends & partners:

In preparation to start itinerationin June 2024, we have outlined some ideas on what makes our ministry in an international church, or IC, powerful and impactful, and a ministry you and your church would want to partner with in missions. IES, where we serve in Jakarta, Indonesia, is a very unique church, a powerful ministry with an impact far beyond those who attend. If you’ve never had an opportunity to be part of an IC, you’re missing out.

IES has seen continued growth since the end of our 20-month government-mandated COVID shutdown and the subsequent 6 months of restrictions we lifted. The week running from Palm Sunday through Easter Sunday this year, including our Good Friday services, we had 2,534 unique attendees check-in for our services. That was a great ministry week for sure. This past weekend we are excited to have broken 1400 in headcounts for our best regular week since we returned. Numbers are great but there’s a lot more to the story of how we help our people grow and minister here in this amazing city and great nation.

If you’re wondering what we do and why anyone would bother to support us, please read below and let us know when we can come to talk with you about ministry in Indonesia and how you and your church can partner with us.

Mike & Chelly Rody

Your Missions Partners in Jakarta, Indonesia

#### IES is a church for every generation.

April 17, 2024

IES is a Church for all ages, where kids are the church today and so are their grandparents. As with most IC's, IES is intentionally a Church for all ages where all are recognized as the Church.

IES, like most International churches, is not limited to a certain age demographic. One of our core values is, "Kids are not the church of tomorrow. They are the church today!"… [_Read more here_](https://therodys.com/articles/ic-series/a-church-of-all-ages)

#### IES is an open door for front sliding.

The variety of cultures and ethnicities in IES and other IC's give us a great opportunity to share faith. We're so obviously different that it's okay to check us out.

#### IES finds partners for effective compassion ministry.

Where IC's are surrounded by great need they become a great tool to impact communities through compassion ministries.

IC members tend to be people of great compassion, aware of their privilege while often surrounded by great need. IC members are often high achievers and doers who have a sense of responsibility to get things done. These factors drive IC's and their people to care for those in need in their community… [_Read more here_](https://therodys.com/articles/ic-series/compassion)

Everyone's a Minister is a mantra and core value of IES, where we are always in ministry development mode, new people are continually raised up for ministry and those who are raised up are often sent off to other great ministry endeavors elsewhere.

IC's are a great place for ministry development… [_Read more here_](https://therodys.com/articles/ic-series/ministry-and-minister-development)

IES is proud to be a church for all nations and ethnicities with representatives from all the continents.

IES has a lot of foreigners though more Indonesians than any other group. Healthy IC's are always sending believers off to other places.
