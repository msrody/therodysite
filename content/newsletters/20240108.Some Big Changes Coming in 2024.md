To our friends and fellow ministers:

In June 2024, we will return to the US to begin itinerating and raising support.

We want to thank those who are already supporting us in our missions efforts here in Jakarta, Indonesia. We left the US to join the pastoral ministry team at International English Service Jakarta (IES) almost 11 years ago. IES is a thriving international church in Jakarta reaching people from all over the world and all over Indonesia. We’ve seen the church grow and plant new churches and even these new churches have planted a new church. This is an exciting ministry in a metropolitan area with over 30 million people.

Why are we finally starting to itinerate now? As we look to the future, we see there are changes ahead and greater ministry opportunities that will require us to find more partners and supporters. We believe this is the right time.

Having not previously itinerated we start this process from the very beginning. For this reason, we need your help.

- We need to schedule services.
- We need help reconnecting with the churches in the Northwest Ministry Network.

Though we request your help, we also intend to be an asset to you and your ministry. We welcome the opportunity to share our passion for missions with the churches of the NWMN or anywhere else God would open the door. Over the last decade, we've actively participated in ministering to individuals of all ages, extending our outreach to children, young families, the elderly, and practically every demographic typically present within a church community. We love to connect with people. Our goal is to help God’s people connect with God’s purpose and His mission. We hope we can partner with you in helping your people make those kinds of connections.

We appreciate your support in connecting us with others in the NWMN. After over a decade overseas, many pastors and churches in the NWMN have no idea who we are and have no connection with us. We do know you, however. Even if it’s been a long time, if you can help connect us to people in your section or your area, or for that matter, anywhere in the network, we would appreciate it. Even a meeting over coffee with friends will be valuable.

Finally, if you and your church would consider supporting us right away, a monthly pledge would help us launch forward on our itineration. Even a small regular pledge would be significant. You can give through AGWM or submit an AGWM regular commitment form for you or your church. Our AGWM account number is: 2512630. We appreciate all 6 of our current supporting churches, and yet we have a long way to go. Please join us.

Thank you for your help on our journey through prayer, service scheduling, giving, connections, and meeting up with us along the way.

We look forward to speaking with you soon.

-Mike & Chelly Rody
