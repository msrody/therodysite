I share this here, right off the top, so that you know we're not the only ones thinking about this. In fact Internationl Churches have a long history and are having expanding impact in most major global cities and many second and third cities as well. IC's are a growing global phenomena and a powerful context for ministry impact."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"My IC experience started when our family moved to Tehran in 1978.

We pastored a church in the US for 13 years. The church, Whatcom New Life Assembly in Ferndale, Washington became a very multi-cultural, if not international church, even though it is located in a relatively homogenious community. I feel this array of experience gives me a perspective on what makes the IC ministry quite important, unique and even a model for healthy churches."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"center","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Chelly leading worship at IES Jakarta","src":"/Articles/IC%20Series/Chelly%20LeadingWorship20230625-sm.jpg"},"children":[]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"An IC is not your average church. Some are small, our church in Baguio City Philippines, at Camp John Hay, rarely had attendance over 60 in the time I attended.

In those IC's that thrive with health and long term impact, be they large or small, there are some common threads."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Typically a thriving IC is marked by diversity in many forms. This is evident in the range of ethnicity represented in the congregation. Most thriving IC's will grow to be very multi-national in nature, even if they start out with just one culture group. When you bring people from many countries together there is a diversity that requires intentionality for unity and growth. Different cultures in the church bring difference of expectations, religious experience and expression."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"How all this diversity comes together is what makes IC's unique. This uniqueness has a great power to impact all involved. In an international church, we see and begin to value different approaches as we value the community we worship with. Things we may have looked ascance at or never considered in a more homogenious setting are now viewed up close. Properly handled, an IC becomes a place where all participants will assess where their culture ends and faith begins."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"center","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"DSC08386 (Small).JPG","src":"/Articles/IC%20Series/DSC08386%20(Small).JPG"},"children":[]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This openness to accept differences begets an openness to growth. I have always seen spiritual growth happen at a much faster pace in IC's than in churches with homogenous congregations. People come for the fellowship but are touched by God because they are open to the changes He is initiating in their lives. We've seen more than one individual who claimed to be Christian come to faith in Christ in the our IC's."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"elements-that-make-ic-ministry-impactful-in-missions"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Elements That Make IC Ministry Impactful in Missions"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The articles that follow are a look at different aspects of IC life, particularly as we live it here at IES Jakarta but are representative of the unique and impactful nature of IC's in a general sense."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"articles-list","props":{"path":"articles/ic-series"},"children":[]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"elements-that-make-ic-ministry-impactful-in-missions","depth":3,"text":"Elements That Make IC Ministry Impactful in Missions"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.articles:IC Series:1.index.md","_source":"content","_file":"2.articles/IC Series/1.index.md","_stem":"2.articles/IC Series/1.index","_extension":"md"},"hash":"D5VcT1Tt2d"}
