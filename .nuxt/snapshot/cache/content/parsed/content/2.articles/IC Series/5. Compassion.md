IC members are often high achievers and doers who have a sense of responsibility to get things done. These factors drive IC's and their people to care for those in need in their community. People working in development or compassion-related fields are often part of the IC congregation and become an asset for the church in connecting with opportunities to care for those in needs as well. The entrepreneurial spirit of many members combines with a passion for ministry and finds new creative initiatives to care for hurting and weak people."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Compassion for kids.","src":"/Articles/IC%20Series/compassion%2020161012_113725-sm.jpg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In IES we work with partners in communities to help them do the ministry they have committed their lives to. We know that we have temporary connection to these communities, but being a resource for long term residents, community members and churches is something we can do effectively. We work with partners in orphanages, schools, garbage dump communities, economically challenged villages. We have fed kids, mentored orphans, provided resources for development of communities being forced to  out of hunter gatherer existence and built homes with Habitat. Working with partners allows us to care for needs while investing in the long term outreach and uplift of these communities. Compassion ministries connect with us."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.articles:IC Series:5.
