Discipline is about prepartation. It's what coaches push athletes to do in preparation for their event. It's what teachers direct students to do in preparation for success. It's what supervisors require to prepare workers to make sure the job is done right and on time. It's what parents do to prepare their kids to function in the world without burning their fingers on the hot stove or electrocuting themselves by licking the electrical socket. Discipline is one way that parents show love to thier children by giving them every opportunity to overcome the obstacles of life. It is a process of developing the mind and muscles to do what's best."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"god-discipline-us-for-good"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"God discipline us for good."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"God also disciplines us as his people.
