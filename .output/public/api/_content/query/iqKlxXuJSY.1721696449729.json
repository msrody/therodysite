Our people tend to be creative, motivated, connected and open to change.

They want to grow in faith and knowledge of God's word and see it lived out in their day and they have the time to do that.

With the transient nature of our congregation, we are always looking for and developing new leaders.  This allows our people to expand their ministry experience and to step up into new roles, trying new ministries.

We have hosted many missionaries to expose them to the possibilities of International Church ministry while they prepare for their ministry here in Indonesia."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.articles:IC Series:7.
