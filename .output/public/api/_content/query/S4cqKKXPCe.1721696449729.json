In the international church setting, people are somewhat disconnected from their regular social connections of their home culture. This make life in church become so much more impactful. People see their personal life transformation more quickly and feel very confident to share their stories and hope with others. Marketplace outreach is a real part of the life of an IC."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Additionally, because church is in English it's often perceived as â€œfor foreigners\".

An IC becomes a safe place to bring those who are not yet in faith or who may have an understanding of cultural Christianity that is not a live and vibrant relationship with Christ. This openness allows many to come for language learning or friendship connections and front slide right into the Kingdom of God. Front sliding is a term we used and have seen often in IES.  As people come to the church they grow in their understanding of what God has for them and over time come to realize they are living for, worshiping and serving God with a vibrant relationship in Him."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.articles:IC Series:4.Great Opportunity To Share Faith.md","_source":"content","_file":"2.articles/IC Series/4.Great Opportunity To Share Faith.md","_stem":"2.articles/IC Series/4.Great Opportunity To Share Faith","_extension":"md"}
